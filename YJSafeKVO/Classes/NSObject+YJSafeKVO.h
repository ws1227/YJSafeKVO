/**
 By using YJSafeKVO, the observers will be generated implicitly and it's safe for not removing observers explicitly because eventually observers
 will be removed before observed target gets deallocated. It's vaild to use it multiple times for applying different changes block with same key path.
 
 If you don't call -unobserve... method when finish key value observing, all implicit generated observers will be removed from observed target before receiver is deallocated. This will automatically happend to avoid the general KVO crash. When the receiver is deallocated before observerd target, the internal observers which related to the receiver will be removed safely as well.
